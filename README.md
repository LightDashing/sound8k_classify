# Sound classification with CNN and LSTM
My pet-project, sound classification on <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/chrisfilo/urbansound8k">UrbanSound8k</a> dataset
All feature extraction and data augmentation in jupyter notebook file. Trained model in .hdf5 file, sound_class.py is model class, all other is application on pyqt for sound file prediction.
If you can't use app with .mp3 file, you need FFmpeg file or something similar.
